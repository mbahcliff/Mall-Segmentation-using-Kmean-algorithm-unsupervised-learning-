# Market segmentation

## Introduction

It is the process of dividing customers into groups or clusters  of shared characteristics. They can be segmented using demographic characteristics such as  age, gender, marital status or phychographic characteristics such as  lifestyle , social class and personality or behavioral characteristics such as spending and consumption habits.

K-means clustering algorithm is one of the well known algorithms for clustering data. Clustering mainly is a task of dividing the set of observations into subsets, called clusters, in such a way that observations in the same cluster are similar in one sense and they are dissimilar to the observations in other clusters. In simple words, we can say that the main goal of clustering is to group the data on the basis of similarity and dissimilarity.


## Need for segmentatrion

It will help in identifying the most potential customers

It help marketers to better target customers with specific ads with regard to those characteristics common to them.

It improves customer experience

## Business goal

My goal is to use Kmean clustering algorithm to perform market segmentation. Market segmentation is the activity of dividing a broad consumer or business market, normally consisting of existing and potential customers, into sub-groups of consumers based on some type of shared characteristics. I hope to gain a deeper understanding of our customers preferences and to discover what each sub group or cluster finds most valuable to them.
